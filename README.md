# Buno Coffee Website

! [Responsive Design](wireframes/responsive-design.png)

<!-- buno coffee's website in action (here place the link)-->

This is a website for Buno Coffee Amsterdam. A brand new cafe in the south of Amsterdam run by my partner and me.
The purpose of creating this website is twofold, educational and commercial.
From a commercial point of view, this website is intendend to provide visitors with basic and essential information about the shop spiced up with some relevant eye-catching images.   
This website has 3 linked pages that categorize relevant material. Here the user will get to know various information starting from the products and quality, menu and prices, opening hours and location, and moreover, their attention will be drawn to some eye-catching and enticing images.   
Later, the page will be linked to the Google.map and redirects the visitors to the website.
The website is aimed at existing and potential customers, especially passers-by who have become aware of the new café but are not yet confident enough to enter the store. Visiting the site should encourage them to try it out and at the same time keep the existing customers up to date with any changes.
