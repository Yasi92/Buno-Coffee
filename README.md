#Milestone Project 1
## Create Buno coffee's website

<!-- buno coffee's website in action -->
### What is this website for?

Hi. This is my 1st milestone project at the Code institute which happens to be a real website for Buno coffee Amsterdam.
The purpose of creating this website is twofold, educational and commercial, which has cost me double the effort to elaborate it from both aspects.
From a commercial point of view, the purpose of this website is to provide visitors with some basic information spiced up with some relevant memorable images.

### What does it do?

This website has ... linked pages that categorise relevant material. Here the users will learn various information starting from the products and quality, menu and prices, opening hours and location, and moreover, their attantion will be drawn to some eye-catching and enticing images.

### UX

The website is aimed at existing and potential customers, especially passers-by who have become aware of the new caf√© but are not yet confident enough to enter the shop. Visiting the site is intended to encourage them to try out the service while still keeping loyal customers informed of any changes.
