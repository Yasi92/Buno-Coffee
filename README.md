### What is this website for?

Hi. This is my 1st milestone project at the Code Institute which happens to be a real website for Buno Coffee Amsterdam.
The purpose of creating this website is twofold, educational and commercial, which has cost me double the effort to elaborate it from both aspects.
From a commercial point of view, the purpose of this website is to provide visitors with some basic information spiced up with some relevant catchy images.

### What does it do?

This website has ... linked pages that categorize relevant material. Here the users will learn various information starting from the products and quality, menu and prices, opening hours and location, and moreover, their attention will be drawn to some eye-catching and enticing images.

### UX

The website is aimed at existing and potential customers, especially passers-by who have become aware of the new caf√© but are not yet confident enough to enter the store. Visiting the site should encourage them to try it out and at the same time inform loyal customers about the latest changes.

User stories:

1. The user wants general information and an intoduction to the place.


2. The user wants to learn the menu items and the prices.


3. The user wants to know the opening hours and/or the location of the place.


4. The user wants to get in touch with the place.
